      "Response: Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be transformative, but the decision should be guided by a clear understanding of your company's strategic goals and technical readiness. AI can enhance operational efficiency, improve decision-making, and unlock new capabilities, but it requires robust data infrastructure, skilled talent, and proper governance to implement effectively. I recommend starting with targeted pilot projects in areas with high ROI potential to assess feasibility and scalability before committing to a broader investment.\n",
